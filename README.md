## 24-Hour Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch for the IEEE 24-Bus System

Step 2 focuses on the Unit Commitment (UC) and Economic Dispatch (ED) problem over a 24-hour time horizon for the IEEE 24-bus system, 
taking into account the generation limits, load demands, transmission constraints, and reserve requirements across the network. 
This project aims to teach you an essential power system optimization model while maintaining system reliability and minimizing operational costs.
